it's been almost a month since the community's launch tasks were announced
I remember feeling thrilled and eager to start right away.
However,after tarying,i realized my main issue is a lack of focus.
I can't manage the three hours of daily intensive study
I stuggle to memorize and thoroughly know the prepared texts.
It's like having the secret to the martial art but being unable to break through.
