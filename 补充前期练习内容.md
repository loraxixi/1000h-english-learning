2024年第一个最大的价值观念改变在于调整工作、育儿和自学的顺序，自学第一，育儿第二，工作最后。主要受李笑来社群里一系列课程的影响。

你可能会问为什么重新对这三件事重新排序？

原因很简单：专注力是一种排它性资源，用在这件事情，就不能用在那件事情上，理所当然需要把它用在最有价值的事情。

自学是一种生产力，是未来能持续创造价值的基础，值得放在首位。

育儿依然很重要，原来我非常自私想把它放在第一位，因为我清楚孩子3岁以前的抚育非常关键，我希望自己能很好的陪伴她，塑造好的亲子关系。但是，成为更好的自己也是给孩子树立榜样，我的自学属于对自己操作系统的升级，这个不能停止。

调整顺序，不代表我不重视工作，不会再花时间陪孩子，相反我依然非常喜欢工作，重视育儿。我只是更好的规划自己的时间和资源，戒掉无效的社交投入和无意义的刷新微博。

追求财富自由之路，从改变顺序开始！当你真的开始改变，你会发现周围的世界焕然一新。

In 2024, the biggest shift in values for me is reprioritizing self-education, parenting, and work, in that order. This change is largely influenced by a series of courses from Li Xiaolai's community.

You might wonder why I'm reshuffling these priorities.

The answer is simple: Attention is an exclusive resource. If it's spent on one thing, it can't be used for another. Naturally, it should be invested in what's most valuable.

Self-education is a form of productivity, the foundation for sustained value creation in the future, and deserves to be at the top.

Parenting is still crucial. I was selfishly putting it first because I know the nurturing during a child's first three years is key, and I wanted to be there to foster a strong bond. However, improving myself also sets an example for my child. My self-education is like upgrading my own operating system, and it can't be put on hold.

Reordering doesn't mean I'll neglect my work or spend less time with my child. I still love my job and value parenting. I'm just planning my time and resources better, cutting out pointless socializing and mindless scrolling through social media.

The journey to financial freedom starts with this change! When you truly start to change, you'll see the world around you in a whole new light.

自从社群里面发布英语自学的启动任务以来，我投入许多的时间整理文本材料，学习如何使用chatgpt，如何搞定工具，如何写文本内容，碰到的问题数量远超过任务里面所提到的部分，我确实做到了立即行动，但是复盘这一段时间的自学过程，我发现自己还未做到真正的“聚焦”，每天3小时的大声开口说话的任务没有完成，不断被小问题所影响，一会去补音标课程，一会又去反复追课程的更新，并没有踏踏实实的做到专注，注意力被分散，被劫持，虽然可以看到一些进步，但是远不及预期。

Ever since the English self-study initiative was announced in our community, I've dedicated a lot of time to organizing materials, learning to use ChatGPT, mastering tools, and crafting text. I've encountered way more issues than the tasks mentioned. I jumped right into action, but reflecting on my study process, I realize I haven't truly "focused." I've failed to complete the daily 3-hour speaking practice. I've been sidetracked by minor issues, bouncing between phonetics courses and constantly checking for updates, instead of concentrating. My attention has been scattered and hijacked. Although I've made some progress, it's not as much as I expected.

尽管“家庭教育”这件事情不能“外包”，但是如果不得已需要给孩子或自己找教练的时候，有一个选择的标准供参考：一定选择一个能提供心理按摩的老师，怎么理解“心理按摩”，就是想办法让你感兴趣，放松压力，而不在于说给你教了多少“秘籍”或“功法”，因为“学”是一群人的事情，但是“练习”是自己的事情，不要指望通过单纯的学提升自己的成绩。

我一直关注的一位数学老师，他就说自己带高年级的孩子，并不是教多少题，有时候就是陪伴和聊天，偶尔丢几道题过去，

While you can't outsource parenting, when you must find a coach for your child or yourself, consider one who offers mental comfort. This means they make learning interesting and reduce stress, rather than just teaching tricks or techniques. Learning involves everyone, but practice is personal. Don't expect mere lessons to boost your performance.

A math teacher I follow says he doesn't just teach older students problems. Sometimes, he simply talks and keeps them company, occasionally tossing a few problems their way.
